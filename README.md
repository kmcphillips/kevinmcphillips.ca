# kevinmcphillips.ca

This is a simple hompage site, for myself.


## How to run it

Clone the project and cd into the folder:

    git clone git@github.com:kmcphillips/kevinmcphillips.ca.git   # or your forked read/write URL here
    cd kevinmcphillips.ca

Then install the gems:

    bundle install

And finally, start the server:

    bundle exec rackup

You should be able to reach the site at:

http://localhost:9292/
